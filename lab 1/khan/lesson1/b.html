    <h1>Whispers of the Soul</h1>
    <p>
    In the silence of the night, a whisper gently weaves,
    A tale of dreams and hopes, where the heart believes.<br>
    Moonlight dances on the waves, a silver, tranquil sea,
    Reflecting the echoes of the soul, wild and free.<br>
    Stars above, like diamonds, sparkle in the velvet sky,
    Each telling secrets of the universe as they pass by.<br>
    Embraced by shadows, the world in peaceful slumber,
    The whispers of the soul, a melody without a number.
